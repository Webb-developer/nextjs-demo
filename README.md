This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started:
1. Youâ€™ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later. Latest LTS version recommended (14.15.4).
2. Clone `git@github.com:puigandrew1/nextjs-demo.git`
3. Run `yarn create next-app`

## Pages:
- In Next.js, a page is a React component exported from a `.js` file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.
Example: `pages/about.js =>` [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about)

- Pages with dynamic routes are possible. Example: `pages/product/[id].js =>` [http://localhost:3000/product/hiphugger](http://localhost:3000/product/hiphugger)

- By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. The HTML is generated at build time rather than run time and will be reused on each request. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

- Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JS, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser. So like an AJAX page load I suppose.

## Assets and CSS:
- Next.js supports CSS modules out of the box.
- We can configure Next.js to [support styled components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components).
- Next.js can serve static files, like images, fonts, pdfs, under the top-level public directory. Example `<img src="/image.png" />` resolves to `/public/image.png`

## API Routes:
- We can create an API endpoint as a Node.js serverless function. Example: `pages/api/email.js =>` [http://localhost:3000/api/email](http://localhost:3000/api/email)
